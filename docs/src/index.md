# CycleSolver.jl

#### Package for solving thermodynamic cycles in steady state 

> This package uses metaprogramming to provide a unique formatting structure for representing cycles and supplying already known properties. Based on this, the algorithm seeks to automatically discover other unknown properties of the system.
>
> In addition to cycle solving, the presented package also offers result visualization features, generating tables and graphs to clearly illustrate cycle properties. This way, the tool allows for a quick and reliable analysis of thermodynamic cycles.
