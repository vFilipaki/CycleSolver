        - Water is used as working fluid;
        - Pressure at the outlet of the low pressure turbine of 10 kPa;
        - Pressure at the outlet of the high pressure turbine of 200 kPa;
        - Pressure at the pump outlet of 1000 kPa;
        - Temperatures after leaving the boiler of 250 Â°C;
        - The pump has an isentropic efficiency of 90%;
        - The turbines have an isentropic efficiency of 80%.
