The `CycleSolver.jl` package uses metaprogramming to provide a unique formatting structure for representing cycles and supplying already known properties. Based on this, the algorithm seeks to automatically discover other unknown properties of the system. In addition to cycle solving, the presented package also offers result visualization features, generating tables and graphs to clearly illustrate cycle properties. This way, the tool allows for a quick and reliable analysis of thermodynamic cycles.
